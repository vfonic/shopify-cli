Shopify CLI 2.0 is a command line to help you build on Shopify. It's available as a Ruby gem and can be run and installed on Mac, Linux, and Windows systems.

## Note on Shopify CLI 2.0 versus Shopify CLI 3.0 ##

Use 2.0 for developing themes. For developing apps and custom storefronts, we recommend using [Shopify CLI 3.0](https://github.com/Shopify/cli).


## Installation 

To install Ada Apps fork of Shopify CLI, clone the repo, switch to `ada-apps-blink-and-butter` branch, build, and install the gem:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vfonic/shopify-cli
cd shopify-cli
git checkout ada-apps-blink-and-butter
gem build shopify-cli.gemspec
gem install shopify-cli-*.gem
```

Picking up new updates:

```sh
git pull
rm shopify-cli-*.gem
gem build shopify-cli.gemspec
gem install shopify-cli-*.gem
```

Hopefully some of these changes will be added to main Shopify CLI repo. Here's the issue I raised about this:
